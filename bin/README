install.sh

  Requires the database.auth file to exist, but will insert a blank Archie database
  and copy the settings.php in place. WARNING WARNING WARNING. This script will
  overwrite existing data in your database, althought it does check for a settings.php
  it should _NEVER_ be run on an existing install as it will wipe out data. 

  It creates a default web interface user called admin with the password admin. Depending
  on when the ../config/database.sql file was created you might be required to update
  the database immeditely upon installation. The ../config/database.sql is only updated
  during a point release and is often out of date in relation to the GIT version. 

backup-site.sh [CONTENT DIR]

  Shell script for backing up the database and content in Archie, you must manually
  pass the path to the root of your content directory as configured in the settings.php
  for the backup script to work properly. The data will be backed up to ./bin/backup

  We also recommend using a service like DropBox https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx
  or Google Drive to backup the backed up data. Please see the respective services 
  documentation for information on how to perform the backups
