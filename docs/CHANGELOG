 Classification not Description
 Fix the edit record to match new style
 New Record now saves material and classification on 'create' attempt, even if there is an error
 Using jquery + bootstrap now, ajax has changed, all visual stuff still
 View has div style, and looks a lot less ugly, no new functionality but I hate it less
 Style changes - fixed menu, next for the rest
 Add scriptaculous and phpqrcode library
 Fix RN always being null on new record creation
 move record and user to database_object class
 Added database object class from Ampache, automates caching of reguarlly used objects, uses ram rather then queries. Showing 100 records it saved us 477 SQL commands
 Add GPL license file and a simple readme, along with a .gitignore file so settings.php isn't accidently commited
